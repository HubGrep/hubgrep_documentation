Welcome to HubGrep's documentation!
===================================

HubGrep is a search engine for open source projects that you can host yourself.

It acts as a proxy to the search function of source code hosters, 
so that you can search once, and get results from all added hosting services.


Currently supported hoster types are Github, Gitlab and Gitea.


try it out: `<https://hubgrep.io>`_!
